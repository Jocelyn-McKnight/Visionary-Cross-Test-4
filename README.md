In 2015 Michael D. C. Drout and Elie Chauvet conducted a study of the moving ratio of thorn and eth in 
the Old English poetic corpus. One of their general conclusions after examining 10 scribes and 48 poems 
within 6 manuscripts was that “scribes exhibit different degrees of deference to the authority of their 
exemplars, but […] the influence of the orthography of an exemplar can […] be detected in the distribution 
of thorn and eth” (Drout and Chauvet 316) or in other words, the use of thorn and eth was the scribe’s 
choice; however, they could be influenced by other factors. Although these conclusions were fascinating 
and groundbreaking <i>for the study of Old English orthography it is difficult to convincingly apply any 
of their many conclusions to the works of Old English prose because the two genres diverge so significantly. 
After all, as Roberta Frank explains, there were West-Saxon scribes who used different spelling conventions 
for prose and </i>poetry (Frank qtd. in Megginson 122) which raises the question of how the use of thorn 
and eth would differ in the Old English prosaic Corpus. Furthermore, when considering the poetic fifth 
dialect theory (Sisam 257-268), it could explain why Drout and Chauvet’s results showed that the general 
distribution of thorn and eth in any given manuscript was close to even; The average of the theta ratios 
was 52.5% and they calculated 57 thorns for every 43 eths in the entire poetic corpus (Drout and Chauvet 
286). It is logical <b>that a fifth dialect that incorporates spelling aspects of other dialects would 
have a stronger mix of thorn and eth than in prose where the scribe is, in general, writing in one 
dialect—whether it is their own or that of the original text—and more importantly, using one spelling 
convention. This naturally</b> leads to the conclusion that if one were to conduct a similar test, as well 
as others, on the use of thorn and eth in Old English works of prose, one would find that the scribes 
highly favour one character or the other because of the theory that Old English prose has a more fixed 
orthographical system.

The most evident observation from this data is that thorn is heavily preferred in these texts. On average, 
for these three texts, for every 70 thorns, there are 11 eths which is a stark contrast to the ratio of 
the poetic corpus. The poetic Book of Exter by far has the highest ratio of theta at 70% (Drout and Chauvet 
289) and even the lowest prosaic ratio listed it is also interesting to note that during the transcription 
process of The Life of St. Margaret, it was clear when scribes B or C made an emendation to the text as 
they would use an eth in a word, especially in the final position. The most memorable example was Scribe 
C replacing Scribe A’s word choice of “rærdeþ” with “macað” in paragraph 19. Within transcribing here is 
almost 8% higher. One might think that this is a deceiving statement because when one looks at the 
individual information of each poem there are many poems that have higher theta ratios than even the life 
of St. Margaret. While this is true, it must also be considered that the “Pharaoh” poem for example, may 
have a 100% theta ratio, but there are only 9 opportunities for the scribe to use thorn or eth in a total 
of eight lines of poetry, and the same is true with most of the other extremely high percentages. It can 
thus be determined that when examining a large portion of prosaic texts, the scribes favour thorn over 
eth, as opposed to the poetic texts which have a more even distribution.
